      "paragraph": "I studied creative advertising and underwent many internships in some of London's most prestigious advertising agencies. My role was to deliver ideas for advertising campaigns with my specialization being copywriting. Concentrated and rich content that delivers a message effectively. I then moved to Sweden where I worked in construction specializing in concrete and steel. It was during this job that I found an interest in tech."

      "paragraph": "During my time in construction I read Wired articles daily. I became fascinated with how fast technology was developing and felt it was crazy not to be a part of the growing industry. What pushed me to do a coding bootcamp was seeing the Falcon X's first launch. Since then, I have never regretted my decision."

I have worked with a client in Stockholm, presenting API data in a dashboard to monitor advertising spend and reach. It's funny to think how much I've grown since I started."
