  title: Copywriter
  text: I went to university to study creative advertising. During this time I found out that I love to write and focussed on becoming a copywriter. All the work I did was fun, engaging and fed the creative side of my brain. I was proud of my work because I set my own brief, expectations and, with the help from my art director, produced work i deemed exceptional. My art directory and I (creatives are hired in pairs) quickly found out this is not the case in the industry.

  title: Tech enthusiast
  text: I first became inspired by tech from my art director / best friend. He built drones, flew them, upgraded his pc manually, built a 3D printer and always told me about the latest tech news. Without knowing it I was slowly being reeled in to the IT industry. From then on I read Wired everyday for over a year and finally came to the conclusion that I have to be a part of it.

  title: Jump!
  text: I took the jump. I read articles online, scoured through /r/learnprogramming, took an online course in Udemy but felt disconnected. As a Newbie it's hard to know where to look. A famous advertiser once said "A blind pig can find truffles, but it helps to know they're found in oak forests." So I stumbled upon Bootcamps.
